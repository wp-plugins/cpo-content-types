Add support for special content types in your website, such as a portfolio, features, and slides.

== Description ==

[CPO Content Types](http://cpothemes.com/plugin/cpo-content-types) is a utility plugin that adds support for a specific set of content elements within your WordPress installation.

This plugin will add three custom post types to your site: slides, features, and portfolios. These post types are meant to work with [CPOThemes](http://cpothemes.com) themes, which take advantage of this plugin to add richer content areas and designs. 

You can still use CPO Content Types for any WordPress theme, although you will have to create your own page templates.

= Included Content Types =
* Slides
* Feature Blocks
* Portfolio Items

= Other highlights =

* Compatible with other themes out there, but no templates included
* The portfolio post type included here is different from other portfolio plugins, and can be used in conjunction with them.
